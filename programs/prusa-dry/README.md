# Prusa drying script

This is a funny little G code script which attempts to dry filament by putting it on a heated bed with a cardboard box over it.
It has not been tested yet.

This was inspired by the Bambu Lab procedure: <https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/general/bambu-filament-drying-cover>

However, we note that procedure requires an enclosed printer and it is unclear whether it works well.
