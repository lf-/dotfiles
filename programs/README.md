# small programs

this is where i keep small programs i wrote as one-offs, but it might turn into
a monorepo. who knows.

## what's in here

- `idevicesyswowog` sqlite adapter for live filtering of `idevicesyslog` on linux
- `nvimsplit` boops the running neovim instance to add a split on a given file
  you can set it as your `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL` inside your vimrc so that any
  editor instances started by like git and stuff will open in the existing
  editor
- `pwist` pretty prints plists
