# haskell.nvim

This plugin allows you to rename modules and switch between tests and source in Haskell.

## Contributing

This project is a Copybara export from <https://github.com/lf-/dotfiles>.
It is significantly easier for Jade if you send her patches on that repo for now, but patches *are* accepted here.
