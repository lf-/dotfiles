1. INTRODUCTION                                             *buck2-introduction*

buck2 is a modern multi-language build system for large codebases. It is
similar to Bazel and uses the same build language, Starlark. There are various
common operations while working in a buck2 codebase that benefit from editor
support, and this is that.

This plugin requires `plenary.nvim`, available on the World Wide Web at
https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim

Features: ~
  * Open Buck files corresponding to a target with `:BuckOpen`
  * treesitter query support for navigating targets in BUCK files by `name`
    attribute.
  * Find the target owning a file using `:BuckTarget`.
